## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(174, 71%, 46%) - A vibrant teal, like #21c9a8, creates a sense of digital sophistication and trustworthiness for a communication app.
- Background color: HSL(174, 13%, 23%) - A dark, desaturated teal (#314642) serves as a professional backdrop for the user interface.
- Accent color: HSL(144, 64%, 48%) - A slightly greener analogous color to the primary, such as #36c45e, distinguishes key interactive elements.
