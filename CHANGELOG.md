## Checkpoint 1: Disable Audio Transcription Feature (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

**Description:**
This checkpoint documents the disabling of the audio transcription feature. The goal was to keep the UI elements for audio recording functional but prevent any backend processing or AI calls for transcription.

- **Frontend (`src/app/page.tsx`):**
    - The `handleSendAudio` function was modified. Instead of processing the audio, creating a message, and calling the backend for transcription, it now:
        1. Checks for online status.
        2. Shows a toast notification: "Feature Disabled - Sending and transcribing audio messages is currently disabled."
        3. Does NOT add an audio message to the chat.
        4. Does NOT attempt to convert the audio blob to a data URI.
        5. Does NOT call the `getAudioTranscription` backend action.
    - This change affects the `handleSendAudio` function (lines 60-71 in `src/app/page.tsx` as of this checkpoint).

- **Backend (`src/app/actions.ts`):**
    - The `getAudioTranscription` server action was modified to ensure it no longer attempts to transcribe audio. It now:
        1. Logs a message to the console: "getAudioTranscription called, but feature is disabled."
        2. Immediately returns a static object:
           `{ transcription: 'Audio transcription feature is currently disabled.', showTranscription: true }`
    - This change affects the `getAudioTranscription` function (lines 6-12 in `src/app/actions.ts` as of this checkpoint).

This ensures that while the user can still interact with audio recording UI, no actual transcription occurs, and the system clearly communicates the feature's disabled state.
